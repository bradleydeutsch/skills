Running the application:

In order to run the Skills Application, you can simple extract the application contents to a folder and open index.html in a browser.  It may ask for permission to use local storage - in this instance, please accept this.  Local storage is used to persist your skills list on the browser.

Running the tests:

You are not able to execute the tests in the same was as you can run the application.  To run the tests you must extract the contents of the application to a folder, and then setup a local domain to point to that folder.

For example:

http://dev.skills.com/ -> where dev.skills.com point to 127.0.0.1

Once this is complete, you can go to http://dev.skills.com/ to run the application, or http://dev.skills.com/tests/ to run the tests.
